# Education

### Makers Academy (March - June 2018)

* ### Concepts
   * Test Driven Development
   * Agile workflow
   * Continous Integration
   * OOP
   * Single responsibility principle

* ### Tech
   * Lanugages: Javascript, Ruby and brief intro to Java and Scala
   * Databases: Postgresql and MongoDB 
   * Frameworks: Express, React, Sinatra, Rails, Jquery
   * Testing: 
     * Javascript: Jasmine, Chai, Nightwatch

### University of Manchester (2012-2015) - 2:1 BSc. (Honours) Social Anthropology

   * Gained strong independent researchs skills and the ability to cleary
   communicate ideas and concepts
   * Read a number of case studies detailing the inner-workings of business, 
   governments and healthcare organisations. This led to an appreciation of the 
   challanges and potential gains of achieving effective communcation between 
   individuals and groups with differing areas of expertise.

## Skills

I have worked hard during my time at Makers to expand my team work and communcation
skills. The best thing I learned at Makers Academy was how to work as part of a team
and follow a modern, proffesional approach to software development.

My prefference is for back-end work and DevOps. I am interested in creating fast, 
scalable software which takes advantage of cloud architecture and modern communication
technlogies. I am currently looking to expand on my groups final project at makers, 
by using a pub/sub service to enable scaling of our application across servers.

## Interests

I have a passion for travelling and playing sports. I have recently travelled
to Asia, South America, Eastern Europe and I spent a year living and working 
in Australia. I like to play football and table tennis and I make sure to do a few
sessions of yoga each week and like to climb in my spare time.
