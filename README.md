### Travelling / Living in Australia (2015 - 2017)

### University of Manchester (2012-2015) - 2:1 BSc. (Honours) Social Anthropology

   * Gained strong independent research skills and the ability to clearly
   communicate ideas and concepts
   * Read a number of case studies detailing the inner-workings of business, 
   governments and healthcare organisations. This led to an appreciation of the 
   challenges and potential gains of achieving effective communication between 
   individuals and groups with differing areas of expertise.

## Skills

During the course I have been told by several other students that I am able to
exaplain technical concepts in a clear and simple way. I believe that through 
the use of metaphors and examples I am able to communicate the fundamental ideas
behind techincal concepts to people who do not have a technical background.

I have worked hard during my time at Makers to expand my team work and communication 
skills. The best thing I learned at Makers Academy was how to work as part of a team
and follow a modern, professional approach to software development.

My preference is for back-end work and DevOps. I am interested in creating fast, 
scalable software which takes advantage of cloud architecture and modern communication
technologies. I am currently looking to expand on my groups final project at makers, 
by using a pub/sub service to enable scaling of our application across servers.

## Interests

I have a passion for traveling and playing sports. I have recently traveled
to Asia, South America, Eastern Europe and I spent a year living and working 
in Australia. I like to play football and table tennis and I make sure to make
time for a few sessions of yoga and climbing each week.
